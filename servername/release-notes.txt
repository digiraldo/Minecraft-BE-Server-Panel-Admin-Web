March 2020 Dedicated Server Release.

	- Make sure to check the how-to document that comes with this release
	- File bugs at https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/BDS/issues

Stability release
* Many bug fixes.
* New crash handling telemetry system.
* Server authoritative inventory: most inventory transactions now happen on the server to prevent cheating.
	- Unlike server authoritative movement this can not be disabled: we are deprecating support for client-side inventory handling.
* Server authoritative movement is still in-progress; we recommend not using it in this release.
